# Python - Almost a Circle
The AirBnB project is a big part of the Higher level curriculum from Holberton School. This project will help you be ready for it.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu `14.04 LTS` using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
* Your code should use the `PEP 8` style (version 1.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
* All your classes should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`

### Python Unit Tests
* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
* You have to use the `unittest` module
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
* All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
* You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
